# Phusion dockerfiles

Some dockerfiles based on the [Phusion base image](http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/).

More kudos to the [Phusion](http://www.phusion.nl/) team as I followed many of same patterns that they used in building their [Passenger](https://github.com/phusion/passenger-docker) images.
